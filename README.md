# Finding and factorizing primes



Finding prime numbers is a compute-intensive task familiar to computer-science students.
It is typically tackled with tightly-iterating algorithms in a language close to the hardware, such as C.
It appears an unrewarding task for a vector-programming language.

We tackle this topic in order to study efficient vector solutions to a well-understood problem domain.
